# EM_Boilerplate

This email boilerplate is based shamelessly on Email on Acid's boilerplate. See http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/html_boilerplate for more information. Email on Acid is pretty awesome, check them out http://www.emailonacid.com/.

This email boilerplate is not good. In fact, it's probably pretty bad. You should use Email on Acid's instead of this one. This boilerplate comes with no warranty.

This boilerplate is intended to provide a starting place for:
• laying out and styling common content blocks
• overcoming common challenges with major email clients
You still need to put the blocks together in your desired order and suplpy the content. And you also need to TEST THE HELL OUT OF your code before delivering (try Email on Acid for that too).

After coding your message and before delivering, do the following:
• remove comments
• inline your CSS (my favorite css inliner is from MailChimp http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/)
• test using a tool like Email on Acid http://www.emailonacid.com/


Dev phase testing is being conducted in the following clients: 
• Outlook 2010 on Win7
• Gmail in Chrome on Win7
• Outlook.com in Chrome on Win7
• Inbox (from Gmail) on Samsung GS4 on Android 5.0.1
• Smasung default email app on Samsung GS4 on Android 5.0.1
